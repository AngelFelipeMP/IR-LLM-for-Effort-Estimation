### Tasks
    + Predict the minimum number of documents that a user will need to read to satisfy his/her information need
    + We frame the problem as a classification task
    + Feature/column from dataset/collection: DocCountAverage
    + Create a Gold label: Round the DocCountAverage to the closest integer (from 2 to 8)

### Data
    + UQV100 dataset
        - Relevant documents/files for the experiments
            - uqv100-backstories.tsv -> contains the backstories
            - uqv100-query-variations-and-estimates.tsv -> contains the queries and the estimates (T)

### Approach
    + Zero-shot learning
    + few-shot learning -> (openAI docs: Tactic: Provide examples)
        + one shot learning
        + five shot learning
        + n shot learning

### ML Models
    + GPT-3/chat
    + GPT-3.5/chat
    + GPT-4/chat

###  Predictions
    + Full dataset
    + Predic T's for the 100 backstories

### Evaluation metrics
        * Accuracy
        * Precision
        * Recall
        * F1-micro, macro and weighted
        * Closeness Evaluation Metric (CEM) (Amig√≥ et al., 2020)
            - CEM is defined explicitly for Ordinal Classification tasks

### Outcomes
    + Results due to Evaluation Metrics
    + Visualization
        * plot the boxplot of T per backstory
            - DocCount
            - ML model prediction
        * plot the boxplot of T per the whole dataset
            - DocCountAverage
            - ML model prediction
    + Analyses

### Ideas (Now)
    + Give the model time to "think"
        * Ask the model to reason before giving an answer
            - I would need a new prompt for this
    + Allow models to browse the internet 
        * OBS: It becomes a different task; however, contrary to  human annotators, the model will be able to 
          read a bunch of documents in a short time
            - I would need a new prompt for this
            - Specify the steps required to complete a task

### Future work
    + Predictions evaluation
        * three categories
            - Remember 
            - Understand
            - Analyze
        * Ask T label for the collection X from "User Variability and IR System Evaluation Peter"
            - Small-scale evaluation
        * I may use collection X to fine-tune an ML model and then predict the three classes for UQV100
            - I am not sure if 180 samples are enough to fine-tune an ML (DL, transformer, or LLM) model
            - Hence, I will be able to carry out a large-scale evaluation of the UQV100 dataset ( based on R, U, and R)
    + Manual labeling of the dataset with the number of necessary documents
        * we would present n documents to the annotator to get the action number
    + I may map "The 6 ratings" to an estimation of the true number of needed documents
        * So I may avoid using human annotators to create the new labels


### prompt
    + Include all necessary information/details in the prompt
    + Provide examples (few-shot learning)
    + Specify the desired length of the output
    + Info from UQV100 paper
        * effort estimates of how many useful documents they would have to read to satisfy the need.
    + prompt itself, it may include:
        * background history/backstories
            - Each backstory provides a brief motivating context, hopefully with some degree of realism, 
            that helps individuals imagine themselves in a similar information-seeking situation and 
            informs their query and effort responses.
        * task description
            - presented the backstory and then asked the worker to enter the first query they would use
              to access information via a search engine in response to the backstory and for estimates of
              the effort (in terms of the number of useful documents and number of queries) that they 
              anticipated needing to satisfy the information need
            - effort estimates using graphical slider widgets ranging from 0 to 101 for the estimation of the number of useful documents required
            - a value T, the expected number of useful documents that will be required
